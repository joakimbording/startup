# Startup Readme
A boilerplate repo for quick project startups. Just like I like it.

## Get started
1. Download this repository
2. Install Node and NPM if not installed already
5. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
6. Run `npm run dev` to start a local web server

## Start working locally
`npm run dev` starts the web server + webpack. Webpack processes Sass + JS. This craft-starter comes ready with [Browser-Sync](http://www.browsersync.io/) â€“ that means that you don't *need* CodeKit.

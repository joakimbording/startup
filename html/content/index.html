<p>Great! Let's do this :D</p>

<h2>Styles in <em>/scss</em></h2>
<p>All in nice BEM structure! Start with the _variables.scss files first.</p>

<h2>Prototype in <em>/html</em></h2>
<p>You find content in html/content and layouts in html/layouts. We use Metalsmith to compile together content in layouts to produce flat html files that are served in the public folder. Never touch these directly. Work in the html folder instead.</p>
